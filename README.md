# Tic-tac-toe

### A little about the program
This is the classic tic-tac-toe game. The first one to line up 3 of their pieces vertically, horizontally or diagonally wins. The players always alternate and after each game the result is summed up who won or was played in a draw.
Was created for entertainment.
